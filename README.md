Scala Mustache
===
An implementation of Mustache in Scala, just as a personal project for my own benefit.

Roadmap
---
* Allow objects to be used as the context for rendering, not just maps - case classes only?
* support set delimiter tag
* strict mode i.e. require keys to be present and usable in the context of the tag
